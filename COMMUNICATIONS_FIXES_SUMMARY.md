# Communications Issues - Fixes Summary

## üéØ **Issues Fixed**

### ‚úÖ **Issue 1: "Unknown User" Names in Messages**

**Problem**: Messages were showing "Unknown User" instead of actual sender names.

**Root Cause**: The sender information enhancement logic in `useCommunications.ts` was not properly falling back to the project client names when the messages API calls failed or returned incomplete data.

**Solution**: 
1. **Enhanced Fallback Logic**: Modified `useCommunications.ts` to establish fallback sender names from conversation's project data BEFORE making API calls
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added better logging and error handling for API calls
3. **Smart Name Resolution**: Logic now prioritizes: API message sender name ‚Üí project client name ‚Üí "Unknown User"

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useCommunications.ts`: Enhanced sender name resolution logic
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Added AdminAuthProvider to root layout
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`: Removed redundant AdminAuthProvider

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
name: lastMessage.sender?.full_name || 'Unknown User'

// After  
name: lastMessage.sender_name && lastMessage.sender_name !== 'Unknown User' 
  ? lastMessage.sender_name 
  : fallbackSenderName // (from project.client_name)
```

### ‚úÖ **Issue 2: Real-time Notifications Not Working**

**Problem**: Messages sent from mobile app were not triggering real-time notifications in the control center.

**Root Cause**: The real-time subscription wasn't properly filtering notifications for the current admin user due to RLS (Row Level Security) constraints.

**Solution**:
1. **Enhanced Subscription Filtering**: Added user authentication checks within the real-time event handlers
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for subscription events
3. **User Verification**: Each incoming notification is verified against the current user's permissions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useRealtimeNotifications.ts`: Enhanced real-time subscription with user filtering

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added user verification for each notification
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
if (!user) return;

// Verify notification accessibility
const { data: notificationCheck, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from('notifications')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', newNotification.id)
  .single();

if (checkError || !notificationCheck) {
  return; // Ignore notifications not accessible to current user
}
```

## üîß **Additional Improvements**

### **Enhanced Logging**
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging sender name resolution
- Added notification subscription status logging
- Better error reporting for API failures

### **Build Issue Fixes**
- Fixed AdminAuthProvider context errors by moving provider to root layout
- Resolved SSR hydration issues with proper client-side rendering

### **Debug Tools**
- Created `src/app/api/debug/notifications/route.ts` for troubleshooting
- Added logging to track notification creation and user matching

## üìã **Testing Performed**

### ‚úÖ **Sender Names**
- Verified Eric Tom's name appears correctly in conversations
- Confirmed fallback logic works for project-based conversations
- Tested API response contains proper sender information

### ‚úÖ **Notifications**
- Confirmed notifications are created for mobile app messages
- Verified real-time subscription setup and filtering
- Tested toast notifications and sound alerts

## üéØ **Expected Results**

After these fixes:

1. **Communications Page**: Should show actual sender names (e.g., "Eric Tom", "Lolo", "Watson") instead of "Unknown User"

2. **Real-time Notifications**: 
   - Messages sent from mobile app should immediately appear in control center
   - Toast notifications should display with sound alerts
   - Notifications should be properly filtered for the current admin user

3. **Control Center Actions**: 
   - "View" and "Reply" buttons should work correctly
   - Direct navigation to specific conversations should function
   - Notification counts should update in real-time

## üîç **Verification Steps**

1. **Check Sender Names**:
   - Go to Communications ‚Üí Messages
   - Verify conversations show actual user names instead of "Unknown User"

2. **Test Real-time Notifications**:
   - Send a message from mobile app
   - Check if notification appears in control center immediately
   - Verify toast notification and sound play

3. **Test Navigation**:
   - Click "View" on a message notification in control center
   - Verify it opens the correct conversation in communications page

## üö® **If Issues Persist**

If sender names still show "Unknown User":
- Check browser console logs for sender name resolution
- Verify project data includes client_name
- Check if API calls to /api/communications/messages are succeeding

If real-time notifications aren't working:
- Check browser console for subscription status logs
- Verify admin user authentication
- Check if notifications are being created in database

## üìÅ **Modified Files Summary**

- `src/hooks/useCommunications.ts` - Enhanced sender name resolution
- `src/hooks/useRealtimeNotifications.ts` - Improved real-time filtering  
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added AdminAuthProvider
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Removed redundant provider
- `src/app/api/debug/notifications/route.ts` - Debug endpoint (new)

The communications system should now properly display sender names and provide real-time notifications with full functionality.
