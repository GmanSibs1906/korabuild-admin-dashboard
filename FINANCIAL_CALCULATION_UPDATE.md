# Financial Calculation Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the financial control system to make "Amount Used" automatically calculated from payment history and "Amount Remaining" calculated as Cash Received - Amount Used.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes - FinancialControlPanel.tsx

#### Amount Used Field
- **Removed**: Edit functionality for "Amount Used"
- **Added**: Display label showing "Auto-calculated from payments"
- **Result**: Field is now read-only and shows calculated value

#### Amount Remaining Field  
- **Changed**: Now calculates as `financialData.cashReceived - financialData.amountUsed`
- **Added**: Display label showing "Cash Received - Amount Used"
- **Result**: Field shows real-time calculation instead of stored value

#### saveEdit Function
- **Removed**: `amountUsed` case (no longer editable)
- **Removed**: `amountRemaining` case (automatically calculated)
- **Result**: Only `cashReceived`, `contractValue`, and credit fields can be edited

### 2. Backend Changes - financial/route.ts

#### GET Request (Data Fetching)
- **Changed**: `amountUsed` now calculated as sum of all payments
- **Changed**: `amountRemaining` calculated as `cashReceived - amountUsed`
- **Removed**: Database fallback for `amount_used` field
- **Result**: Values are always calculated from current data

#### POST Request (Data Updates)
- **Added**: Payment total calculation in both update and insert operations
- **Changed**: `amount_used` field populated with calculated payment total
- **Changed**: `amount_remaining` field populated with `cashReceived - calculatedAmountUsed`
- **Result**: Database always stores calculated values, not user input

## Results

### Before Changes:
- Amount Used: Editable field stored in database
- Amount Remaining: Editable field stored in database
- Potential inconsistency between payments and reported usage

### After Changes:
- Amount Used: Auto-calculated sum of all payments (read-only)
- Amount Remaining: Auto-calculated as Cash Received - Amount Used (read-only)
- Perfect consistency between payment history and financial reporting

## Example Calculation:

```
Project: Example Home Construction
Contract Value: $500,000
Cash Received: $300,000 (editable by admin)

Payment History:
- Payment 1: $50,000 (Foundation)
- Payment 2: $75,000 (Framing) 
- Payment 3: $30,000 (Electrical)
Total Payments: $155,000

Calculated Fields:
- Amount Used: $155,000 (sum of payments)
- Amount Remaining: $145,000 ($300,000 - $155,000)
```

## Impact

### âœ… Benefits:
1. **Data Integrity**: Amount Used always matches actual payment total
2. **Automatic Updates**: Changes to payments automatically update financial overview
3. **Simplified UI**: Less confusion about editable vs calculated fields
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear relationship between payments and financial utilization

### ðŸ”’ Administrative Control:

### ðŸ“± Mobile App Impact:
- Users see accurate financial data reflecting actual payment history
- Amount Used represents real money spent/allocated
